## Topic 5: Waiting Lists 

## Project Aims

This project aims to answer the following research questions:

1. Identifying Patient Pathways and RTT activities 
2. Who is waiting?  
3. What are the consequences of waiting? 

These points were investigated through a descriptive analysis of personal characteristics within Waiting List data followed by using causal methods (Difference in Difference) to observe and quantify patterns in healthcare utilisation of patients.
